<h3 align="center">A passionate developer from HCM City, Vietnam</h3>

I'm majoring in Data Science at the VNU-HCM, University of Science.
I started programming 5 years ago with competitive programming about data structures and algorithms. My fields of interest now are Machine Learning and Big data. Currently, I'm focusing on Computer Vision especially in Digital Image & Video processing and Big data frameworks likes Hadoop, Spark, Hive, ...
Besides that, I also learn some new technologies by learning courses, reading articles, etc. I have a good knowledge about C/C++, Python 3, R, js. I also have a little understanding of website building, frontend and design.
My strengths are high determination, ability to learn new technology knowledge quickly.
